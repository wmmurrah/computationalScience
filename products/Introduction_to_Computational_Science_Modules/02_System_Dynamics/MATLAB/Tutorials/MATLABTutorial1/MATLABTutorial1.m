Add the fractions% (not decimal numbers) one-half and three-fourths. MATLAB returns a% decimal expansion.%% Quick Review Question 6	log10(x) is the common logarithm of x, or% logarithm to the base 10.  Evaluate the common logarithm of 23.4,% recording your answer in MATLABTutorial1.m.%% Quick Review Question 7	log(x) is the natural logarithm of x, usually% written as ln(x) in mathematical notation.  Evaluate the sine of the% natural logarithm of 23.4.%% Quick Review Question 8	e^x is exp(x) in MATLAB.  Evaluate the number% e^2.% Variables and Assignments%% Quick Review Question 9	% a.	Assign 4.8 to the variable time and execute the statement.  %% b.	Type time and execute.  %% c.	Type time + 3 and execute.%% d.	Type time and execute.  Note that execution of Part c did not% change the value of time.%% e.	Type ans and execute.  Note that the result of Part c is returned.%% f.

Type an expression for (7 + vel / 3)^2 and execute.%% Quick Review Question 11	Write a segment to assign 34 to variable time% and then to add 0.5 to time, changing its value.%% Quick Review Question 12	Repeat the previous question suppressing the% output from the initial assignment.% User-defined Functions%% Quick Review Question 13	Define a function f(x) = 3sin(x - 1) + 2.% Evaluate the function at 5.  %% Quick Review Question 14	% a.	Clear any possible values for p and t.  %% b.	Define the population function p(t) = 100e^(0.1t). %% c.	Evaluate p at t = 12.  % Online Documentation%% Quick Review Question 15  % a.    By typing a command, obtain help on the function exp.%% b.    List two ways to obtain help on the function exp from the Help% menu.% Displaying%% Quick Review Question 16	Write a statement to assign 3 to t.  Then,% employ disp and num2str to display "Velocity is", the result of the% computation -9.8 * t, and "m/sec."  For proper spacing, be sure to type% blanks in the string constants after "is" and before "m/sec".  Output for% the disp command should be as follows:% Velocity is -29.4 m/sec.% Looping%% Quick Review Question 17	Write a segment to assign 1 to a variable d% without displaying 1.  In a loop that executes 10 times, change the value% of d to be double what it was before the previous iteration.  After the% loop, type d so that MATLAB displays d's final value.  Before executing% the loop, determine the final value so you can check your work.%% Quick Review Question 18	This question is a variation of Quick Review% Question 17.  Write a segment to assign 1 to a variable d without displaying 1.  % In a loop that executes 10 times, change the value of d to be double what it % was before the previous iteration and then print the value of d in a long sentence.  % Use a continuation symbol to break the long disp command; be sure to have the % continuation symbol (?) at the end of the line, not in single quotation marks, and % after a comma.  The output appears on 10 lines.%% Quick Review Question 19	For this question, complete another version of% the segment above that displays distance and time.  In this version, do% not initialize dist.  Employ a loop with an index i that takes on integer% values from 1 through 7.  Within the loop, the value of dist is computed% as 2.25i.  After replacing each xxxxxxxxxx with the proper code, execute,% and compare the results with the similar segment above.% for xxxxxxxxxx%    dist = xxxxxxxxxx						%    t =  (24.5 - sqrt(600.25 - 19.6 * dist))/9.8;%    disp(['For distance = ', num2str(dist), ...%        ' time = ', num2str(t), ' seconds.']);% xxxxxxxxxx%% Quick Review Question 20% a.	Clear possible values for the symbols qrq20 and x.%% b.	Define the function qrq20(x) = ln(3x + 2).  Recall that log is the% MATLAB function for the natural logarithm.%% c.	Write a loop that prints the value of k and qrq20(k) for k taking% on integer values from 1 through 8.% Plotting%% Quick Review Question 21	Graph e^sin(x) from -3 to 3. %% Quick Review Question 22	Adjust the answer to the previous Quick Review% Question to label the x and y axes.  %% Quick Review Question 23 	Adjust the answer to the previous Quick Review% Question to plot e^sin(x) and sin(x) on the same graph.% Differentiation%% Quick Review Question 24	Give MATLAB code to do the following:% a.	Make x a symbol.%% b.	Define y = 2.9 sin(0.03x).%% c.	Evaluate the derivative of y with respect to x.%% d.	Evaluate the derivative of y at 35.% Solving Differential Equations%% Quick Review Question 25	Write a MATLAB command to solve the% differential equation P'(t) = 0.1P(t) with initial condition P(0) = 100.% The module on "Unconstrained Growth" uses this differential equation.% Integration%% Quick Review Question 26	% a.	Designate that x is a symbol.%% b.	Obtain the indefinite integral of (sin(x))^2.%% c.	Obtain the indefinite integral of (sin(x))^2 from 0 to 2¹.
