The program contains two model: the residential choice model and the school choice model. One should 1/ click on setup to initialize the residential choice model 2/ press the go button to let the residential model run 3/ to launch the school model one needs to stop running the go button, click on the setup2 button to initialize the school choice model 4/ click on go2 to launch the school choice model. The program can only work in this order of steps. One needs to reinitialize to residential model to start a new simulation.The results presented in the paper were elaborated using the behaviour space experiment. One should use goBis procedure combined with behaviour space to replicate the same results under the same experimental conditions as in the paper. For this use number-ticks-FM to set how many iterations one wants the residential choice model to run, and number-ticks-SC to set how many iterations one wants the school choice model to run.The data produced were analysed using R and the graphs were drawn using the packages plotly and ggplot2.
