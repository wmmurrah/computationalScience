PeerRevGame.nlogo is a NetLogo software for the Peer Review Game model by Federico Bianchi, Francisco Grimaldo, Giangiacomo Bravo, and Flaminio Squazzoni. It represents a population of scientists endowed with a proportion of a fixed pool of resources. At each step scientists decide how to allocate their resources between submitting manuscripts and reviewing others' submissions. Quality of submissions and reviews depend on the amount of allocated resources and biased perception of submissions' quality. Scientists can behave according to different allocation strategies by simply reacting to the outcome of their previous submission process or comparing their outcome with published papers' quality. Overall bias of selected submissions and quality of published papers are computed at each step.
