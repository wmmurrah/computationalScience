The model is not an exact replication since we have a somewhat simpler landscape of sugar and spice resources included, as well as a simple reproduction rule where agents with a certain accumulated wealth derive an offspring (if a nearby empty patch is available). \nThe model is discussed in Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling by Marco Janssen.
