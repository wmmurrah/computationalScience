Activities and topics associated with learning a programming-language-style tool are fundamentally different than those for system dynamics tools, such as Vensim or STELLA, so the flow of the tutorial materials is considerably different.  Thus, students should complete "R Computational Toolbox Tutorial 1" before "R System Dynamics Tutorial 1."  Moreover, there is only one system dynamics tutorial instead of two.
