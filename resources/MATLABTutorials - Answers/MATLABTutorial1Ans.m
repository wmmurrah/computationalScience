Then,% employ disp and num2str to display "Velocity is", the result of the% computation -9.8 * t, and "m/sec."  For proper spacing, be sure to type% blanks in the string constants after "is" and before "m/sec".  Output for% the disp command should be as follows:% Velocity is -29.4 m/sec.t = 3;disp(['Velocity is ', num2str(-9.8 * t), ' m/sec'])% Looping%% Quick Review Question 17	Write a segment to assign 1 to a variable d% without displaying 1.  In a loop that executes 10 times, change the value% of d to be double what it was before the previous iteration.  After the% loop, type d so that MATLAB displays d's final value.  Before executing% the loop, determine the final value so you can check your work.d = 1;for i = 1:10   d = 2 * d; endd%% Quick Review Question 18	This question is a variation of the previous%% Quick Review Question.  Write a segment to assign 1 to a variable d% without displaying 1.  In a loop that executes 10 times, change the value% of d to be double what it was before the previous iteration and then% print the value of d.  Use a continuation symbol in the disp command.% The output appears on 10 lines.d = 1;for i = 1:10   d = 2 * d;   disp(['The new distance is ',  ...         num2str(d), '.']);end%% Quick Review Question 19	For this question, complete another version of% the segment above that displays distance and time.  In this version, do% not initialize dist.  Employ a loop with an index i that takes on integer% values from 1 through 7.  Within the loop, the value of dist is computed% as 2.25i.  After replacing each xxxxxxxxxx with the proper code, execute,% and compare the results with the similar segment above.for i = 1:7   dist = 2.25 * i;						   t =  (24.5 - sqrt(600.25 - 19.6 * dist))/9.8;   disp(['For distance = ', num2str(dist), ...       ' time = ', num2str(t), ' seconds.']);end%% Quick Review Question 20% a.
